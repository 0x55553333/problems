title: Single Machine Preemptive Total Completion Time
---

# Problem
Find a schedule for jobs such that $j$th job takes $p_j$ time and can start processing only after time $r_j$ allowing preemptions. If $C_j$ is the completion time of the $j$th job, then $\sum C_j$ is minimized. 

# Algorithms

Shoretest Remaining Processing Time first rule.
