# Problem
Let $H$ be a finite set, $W$ is linearly ordered set by $\leq$ and $w:2^H\to W$ such that 
it is monotonic i.e. $F\subset G \subset H$, then $w(F)\leq w(G)$. $w$ also have locality, thus for all $F\subset G\subset H$, and all $h\in H$. If $w(F)=w(G)$ and $w(G) < w(G\cup \{h\})$, then $w(F) < w(F\cup \{h\})$.

Find a minimumal $G\subset H$, such that $w(G) = w(H)$.
