title: Independent arc cover partition
---

Let $S$ be $n$ points on the unit circle. A set of arcs of degree $d$ is called independent, if no points in $S$ get's coverd by more than one arc.

Find a family $F$ of independent sets of arcs, such that the arcs covers all the points, and $|F|$ is minimized.
